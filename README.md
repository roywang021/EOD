Code for AAAI2024 paper: Towards Evidential and Class Separable Open Set Object Detection


The Evidential Object Detector (EOD) is implemented using the [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) object detection framework and follows the open-set configuration of [Opendet](https://github.com/csuhan/opendet2). Gratitude is extended to the original authors for their valuable contributions and commitment to open source.

### Basic Setup
The fundamental setup tasks (e.g., installation and dataset preparation) can be easily accomplished by referring to the guidelines provided in Detectron2 and Opendet.

### Usage
As we utilize the Detectron2 framework, shared with Opendet, the essential code from the paper is provided. This enables straightforward reproduction through the following steps.

1. Identify the modules that need to be replaced in the Faster-RCNN according to the detection framework and open-set settings.

2. Copy the corresponding files or folders from this repository to the appropriate locations in the project.

3. Make modifications and adaptations as needed.
